## Problem we are solving

Globally, 931 million tonnes of food waste were generated in 2019, 61 per cent of which came from households (nearly 570 million tonnes), 26 per cent from foodservice and 13 per cent from retail. Indian households wasted around 68.7 million tonnes of food in 2019. And this number increases year by year. The major problem people faces when wasting food instead of eating or using, is that people genarally do not know how to compost waste food, moreover why should they compost that food because they will not get anything by composting that food, also they don't want to go to different shops to sell their composted food.

## How we are solving

Yum Earn is an android app which will help people to earn through the waste food.
Using our app user can post waste food that he want to sell and one of our picker boy will pick that waste food from the userâ€™s provided address. Then we will compose that waste food into fertilizers and sell them into the market. This process will take time till than the money will be added in userâ€™s account and in future as the fertilizer process completes, user will be able to redeem that money. At each post, there will be an status shown that how far their waste in the process to turn in money and as that complete, money will be added to userâ€™s account and he can redeem it.

Hence a user not composting that waste food, also he/she will earn good profits through it. Therefore using this initative the user can contribute to green environment, because the products like bio fuels, fertilizers and biodegradble bags can be made by using that waste food. And in today's polluting environment we need something which can gives us to for a better future.

## Feasibility and Future

As we know that day by day we are wasting a lot of food. There is no reason to read the facts and figures because our birthday parties already tells that we are in a world where we have taken food for granted. An estimated 931 million tonnes of food were wasted globally in 2019, enough to circle the Earth seven times.
